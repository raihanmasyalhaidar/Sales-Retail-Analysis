## Overview
In the modern era, e-commerce platforms have become a vital part of the global economy, enabling businesses to reach a wider audience and customers to enjoy seamless shopping experiences. As the e-commerce industry continues to grow, analyzing its data becomes crucial for gaining actionable insights that drive business decisions. This project focuses on E-Commerce Analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, with the aim of uncovering key patterns, trends, and insights from e-commerce data. By leveraging Python and Jupyter Notebook, this project provides an end-to-end analysis of an e-commerce dataset, covering various aspects such as:
1. Customer behavior and demographics
2. Sales performance across different periods (e.g., monthly, yearly)
3. Best-performing products and categories
4. Profitability trends and revenue streams
5. Anomalies or outliers in the data

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. Understanding Customer Behavior: Analyze customer purchase patterns to identify loyal customers, preferred product categories, and potential areas for marketing focus.
2. Identifying Key Trends: Gain insights into seasonal sales trends, revenue patterns, and product popularity to support strategic decision-making.
3. Data-Driven Decision Making: Use the findings to propose actionable business strategies, such as optimizing inventory, targeting specific customer segments, or improving marketing efforts.

## Dataset
The data used is a dummy sales dataset from the Tokopedia e-commerce platform. To facilitate its application, the dataset has been modified and consists of several components, including order details, SKU details, customer details, and payment details.

## Methodology

#### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning
* Load the e-commerce dataset, inspect its structure, and handle missing or inconsistent data.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualize sales trends over time (e.g., line plots for monthly sales).
* Analyze product performance to identify best-selling items or categories.
* Examine customer demographics and purchase behavior.

#### 3. Key Insights and Visualizations
* Create meaningful charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, heatmaps, scatter plots) to illustrate key findings from the data.

#### 4. Actionable Recommendations
* Based on the analysis, provide insights and suggestions for improving business strategies.

#### 5. Tools Used
* Programming Language : Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Libraries : Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
